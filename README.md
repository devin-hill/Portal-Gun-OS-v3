## Summary

This repository is a work in progress to update EVARATE's [3d printable Portal Gun](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6191828) v3.

The current repository's parts list seems to be outdated and doesn't provide links to everything that is needed. I intend to upload an updated one as soon as I confirm that I have all the right parts.

I also have some ideas on making minor updates to the 3D models, such as more accurate arms with cages.

There are a couple questions on the main repository about the wiring diagram that have gone unanswered. I also have some questions about the wiring, and once I get those figured out I plan on uploading a new wiring diagram and instructions.

These are the main things I'm focusing on now. I have a few ideas for additions to the Portal Gun, but want to get v3 squared away and documented first.
